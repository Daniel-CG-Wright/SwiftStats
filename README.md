This is the source code for SwiftStats, a custom spotify stats website, using Next.JS framework.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use npm run dev on the root directory to start the development server. This will start the server on localhost:3000.
From there, you can navigate to the website and see the changes you make to the code.
